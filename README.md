## 💫 About Me

Greetings, seeker of thought and code.

I am **Anubhav Shrivastava**, known across platforms as **@Anubhavauthor** — a self-help author, deep thinker, and digital explorer. My work straddles both realms: the inner world of words and the outer structure of code.

By the age of 17, I had tasted the ink of earnings from my writing, explored the raw terrains of digital markets, and learned to position purpose-driven content in competitive spaces.

> **My mission?**  
> To explore the *highest potential of being human* — and walk that path with others through transformative words and meaningful creations.
